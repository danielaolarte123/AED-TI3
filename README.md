## Summary: 

ICESI routes objective is to help new students when they first get to know their university and the routes to take in order to get to their desired place in the lowest time. In this program, the student should select the place where they are currently located and also select the place where they want to head. In a matter of seconds the program should provide the student with all the possible routes to get to their destination. The route list is sorted, making the first option of the list the best route to take. The list also shows how far the student's destionation is from where they are and an estimation of the time that it should take to get there.
